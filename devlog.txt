Damerau-Levenshtein could be better, but i dont really know

Fixed a memory leak

Day 2 (05.01.26):

Creating the structures for slides and recipes
Also added headers

clang++ <files> -o <executable> -lraylib -lGL -lopenal -lm -lpthread -ldl -lX11 -lXrandr -lXi -lXxf86vm -lXcursor -std=c++11
^^^

compile

Started doing the files work... thank god for https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem
Also did some fixes (e.g. printToConsole()'s )

Day 3 (12.01.26)

Resumed work! Trying to understand libzip
Decided to switch to miniz, libzip is lowkey stupid.
YAAAYY I DID THE UNZIPPING FUNCTION (i hope, testing it later)

Day 4 (17.01.26)

ZIP WORKSSS!

screens/zipcode.png

Going to make recipelist struct
Done!

Day 5 (19.01.26)

Making unpack(), on last stage.
Did it. Some bugs wre on my way:
- Bad inih linking
- I went through the directories with directory_iterator when my syntax
just for(int i = 1;; i++)
- Bad zip
- No copy override
- Typo: mixed up a pic variable and a title variable in one place
- The replace_extention modificated the path, solved with making a fs::path out2 = out;
The only screen I have is last error (first_big_bug.png)
Also the success screen! (success_unpack.png)

Day 6 (21.01.26)

Gonna make the loading of recipes from recs folder
Also, overloaded some operators.
Did it!
Errors I met:
std::find(*this->recipes.begin(), *this->recipes.end(), a)
Here, *this->recipes.begin() is a Recipe, and not an iterator, as it
reads this as *(this->recipes.begin()) and not as (*this)->recipes.begin()
success!

Day 7 (22.01.26)

Gonna make archiving and start the pack.
Logic in the unpack() was awful, but my head hurts, so im gonna fix this tomorrow.

Day 8 (23.01.26)

Gonna fix the logic.
Fixed!

Day 9 (24.01.26)

Was making the pack().
I've met a lot of errors.
1. (pic - srcpantosrcpan.png)
I forgot that .replace_extention() mutates the path (23:31, my throat is sore)
Fixed by adding a new var
2. (pic - faultynewfolderlogic.png)
Accidentally added a !, which made the func so search for an occupied path instead
of a free one.
Fixed by deleting the !.
3. (pics - noslides.png
           noslidesreason.png)
Because I forgot to add the right path to std::ofstream slidetxt,
it spawned the slide in the directory I launched it from.
Fixed by adding the real path.
4. (pic - Failed!.png)
The unpack() with it's bad logic betrayed me... again.
Fixed the unpack()... again.

Starting to make the interface tomorrow! (I hope)

Day 10 (25.01.26)

Moved to CLion from VSCode, structured the project, added CMake
Made a wrapper, taught some raylib (pic - wrapper.png)
Also made a resizing func (pic - 67.png)

Day 11 (26.01.26)

Gonna make Scene and SceneManager
made the abstract class scene, also made the font loading!
fixed a bit of srcpanmngr

Day 12 (27.01.26)

Made the RecipeViewScene and SceneManager classes.
They work.
Because scene class is abstract, I had to use unique pointers. The GeeksForGeeks article was quite helpful.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/unique_ptr-in-cpp/
Also used the LSP (Liskov substitution principle) 🤓🤓
Image btw (pic - Recipeview.png)
(dw, its not an error, I just displayed the placeholder recipe)

Day 13 (28.01.26)

Going to make the slide scene rn
Almost done!
Eureka! I can change the parameters of the scene instead of the scene itself! How didnt I get it at first 😭😭
Fixed SRCPANmngr.cpp! Images were wrong, fixed the path.
