Going to make recipelist struct
Done!

Day 5 (19.01.26)

Making unpack(), on last stage.
Did it. Some bugs wre on my way:
- Bad inih linking
- I went through the directories with directory_iterator when my syntax
just for(int i = 1;; i++)
- Bad zip
- No copy override
- Typo: mixed up a pic variable and a title variable in one place
- The replace_extention modificated the path, solved with making a fs::path out2 = out;
The only screen I have is last error (first_big_bug.png)
Also the success screen! (success_unpack.png)
